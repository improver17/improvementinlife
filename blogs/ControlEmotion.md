  Emotions are a natural part of humans, we experience various types of 
emotions within ourself some are happy, some are sad and some are 
angry. Stoicism teaches us that these emotions are just events that 
happening on external part of life.

The judgments and interpretations of events lead us to the inner emotions that we feel, the more we attach our desire or intuition to the event the more chances that we have one of the emotions start growing in our mind.

For example, if you see your beloved one at front, your brain start to attach the feelings like happiness, calmness and a deep state of satisfactory. 

According to Epictetus, a prominent Stoic philosopher, "It's not the events in our lives that cause our troubles; it's our interpretation of those events."

By recognizing that the external stimuli are often influenced by biases, assumptions, and preconceptions. By becoming more mindful of our thought processes, we can learn to separate our judgments from objective reality. This allows us to respond more constructively to challenging situations, rather than merely reacting impulsively based on our initial emotional responses.

We humans act directly on the basis of our emotions, thus the aftermath of these actions are not always good, just by staying calm a bit, then bringing our focus towards breath, we could separate ourself from the external stimuli and act with our intellect and calm mind.

In the beginning this methods is hard to follow but trust me just by staying calm in the situations we can detach ourself from taking any foolish actions.

Second thing we can do is to understand and accept your emotions. Understand the emotion that you currently feeling do not matter if it is happy, sad or angry. Then accept it,  Accepting your emotions doesn't mean you have to act on them; it means you acknowledge their presence and are willing to work with them.
